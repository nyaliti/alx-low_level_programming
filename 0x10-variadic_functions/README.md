<h1>VARIADIC FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. In C, they are implemented using ellipses (…) to indicate that the function can take any number of arguments.</p>
<h2>Task 0: sum_them_all</h2>
<p>The <code>sum_them_all</code> function returns the sum of all its parameters. If n == 0, it returns 0.</p>
<h2>Task 1: print_numbers</h2>
<p>The <code>print_numbers</code> function prints numbers, separated by a string. If the separator is NULL, it doesn't print anything.</p>
<h2>Task 2: print_strings</h2>
<p>The <code>print_strings</code> function prints strings, separated by a string. If the separator is NULL, it doesn't print anything. If one of the strings is NULL, it prints "(nil)" instead.</p>
<h2>Task 3: print_all</h2>
<p>The <code>print_all</code> function can print anything, depending on the format string. The format string can contain the following specifiers: c (char), i (integer), f (float), and s (string). If the string is NULL, it prints "(nil)" instead.</p>
